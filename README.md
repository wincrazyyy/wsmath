# WSMath

WSMath is an online portfolio website for an international mathematics exam strategist. It’s designed to present tutoring services in a clear, premium way, while making it easy to maintain and update content over time.

The site is built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, with a focus on:
- **Sleek, responsive design** (works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- **SEO-friendly structure** to help potential clients discover the site
- **Clear service positioning** for international curricula (e.g. IBDP, A-Level, IGCSE)
- **Fast content updates** via a custom CMS, built for simple day-to-day editing

## Custom CMS (Content Management)

To keep content management simple, WSMath includes a lightweight custom CMS so updates (copy, testimonials, packages, images, etc.) don’t require digging through the whole codebase.

The CMS uses a **Zero Trust login** approach to reduce exposure and keep admin access locked down.

## What this website is for

- Introduce the tutor / brand professionally
- Showcase course options and outcomes
- Highlight student results and testimonials
- Provide an easy way for clients to enquire and book lessons
- Keep everything easy to update without rebuilding the site’s structure each time

## Tech stack (high level)

- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- Custom CMS with **Zero Trust login**

If you’re maintaining this project: keep content updates inside the CMS workflow, and treat the public site as a polished, read-only marketing surface.
