    {
      "q": "Who is WSMath best for?",
      "a": "WSMath is for IBDP (AA/AI, HL/SL), A-Level / IAL, and IGCSE students who want a structured, exam-first plan—with clear weekly actions, accountability, and measurable grade improvement."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I choose between 1-to-1 coaching and group class?",
      "a": "Group is the most cost-effective way to follow a full structure and routine. 1-to-1 is fully personalised with faster feedback and more targeted pacing."
    },
    {
      "q": "What language are lessons taught in?",
      "a": "Lessons are primarily delivered in Cantonese/Mandarin to ensure genuine understanding. All exam execution is trained in English — questions, key terms, and written solutions in the markscheme style. Full English delivery is available on request."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do lessons work?",
      "a": "Lessons are run live on Zoom and are highly interactive. I’ll explain the core concept, then we apply it immediately through targeted past-paper questions with markscheme-focused thinking. After each lesson, you’ll receive structured homework to consolidate the skills and eliminate recurring errors. \n\nFace-to-face lessons are also available at my centre in Times Square, Causeway Bay."
    },
    {
      "q": "How many hours per week do I need for an IBDP Level 6 / 7?",
      "a": "As a baseline, a Level 6 typically requires around 6 hours per week in total (lessons + independent practice), while a Level 7 usually requires 7+ hours per week. The exact plan depends on your current level, how quickly you need to improve, and how consistently you can follow the weekly workload."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if my foundation is weak or I’m behind?",
      "a": "That’s very common. We start with a diagnostic to pinpoint the exact gaps, rebuild the fundamentals by topic, and only then scale into past papers and markscheme execution. You’ll follow a weekly plan designed to turn weak areas into reliable exam marks."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you offer trial lessons?",
      "a": "Private Coaching (1-to-1): Yes — a trial session is available upon request, mainly to confirm fit and set expectations.\n\nIBDP Math Level 7 Mastery System (Group): No — it’s a structured programme designed to work as a complete system (diagnosis → plan → practice → feedback loops), so a single session wouldn’t reflect the real process or outcomes."
    },
    {
      "q": "What should I prepare before the first lesson?",
      "a": "An iPad + Apple Pencil + GoodNotes is ideal for clean, fast, and interactive work. Please also ensure a stable internet connection. Most importantly, be ready to follow the weekly practice plan between lessons — that’s where the biggest gains come from."
