    {
      "q": "Who is WSMath for?",
      "a": "WSMath is for IBDP (AA/AI HL/SL), A-Level/IAL, and IGCSE students who want a structured, exam-first plan—with clear weekly actions, accountability, and measurable grade improvement."
    },
    {
      "q": "How are lessons run?",
      "a": "Lessons are run live on Zoom and are highly interactive. I’ll explain the core concept, then we apply it immediately through targeted past-paper questions with markscheme-focused thinking. After each lesson, you’ll receive structured homework to consolidate the skills and eliminate recurring errors. \n\nFace-to-face lessons are also available at my centre in Times Square, Causeway Bay."
    },
    {
      "q": "How many hours per week do I need for a Level 6 / 7?",
      "a": "As a baseline, a Level 6 typically requires around 6 hours per week in total (lessons + independent practice), while a Level 7 usually requires 7+ hours per week. The exact plan depends on your current level, how quickly you need to improve, and how consistently you can follow the weekly workload."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you teach in English or Chinese?",
      "a": "Lessons are primarily delivered in Cantonese/Mandarin to ensure genuine understanding. All exam execution is trained in English — questions, key terms, and written solutions in the markscheme style. Full English delivery is available on request."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if my foundation is weak?",
      "a": "That’s very common. We start with a diagnostic to pinpoint the exact gaps, rebuild the fundamentals by topic, and only then scale into past papers and markscheme execution. You’ll follow a weekly plan designed to turn weak areas into reliable exam marks."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you offer trial lessons?",
      "a": "Usually no — my teaching is a system (diagnosis → plan → practice → feedback loops), so a single lesson doesn’t represent the real experience or results."
    },
    {
      "q": "Group class vs 1-to-1 — what’s the difference?",
      "a": "Group is the most cost-effective way to follow a full structure and routine. 1-to-1 is fully personalised with faster feedback and more targeted pacing."
    },
    {
      "q": "What do I need to prepare?",
      "a": "iPad + Apple Pencil + GoodNotes is ideal for fast, interactive work. A stable internet connection and willingness to practise between lessons matter most."
